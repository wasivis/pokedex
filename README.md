This is my first fullstack React project! It's a Pokedex made using JavaScript, Typescript, HTML, CSS and data from the PokeAPI.

Features:

- Type and Region/Gen filters (combinable).
- Order by ID or Name.
- Display Shiny forms.
- Choose favorites, saving them in local storage and displaying them by hovering over the heart emoji at the top.
- Partial/full search by name.
- Show modal with artwork, main stats and information when clicking each card.
- Choose and display varieties (if available), such as Megaevolutions or Gmax.
- Next/Prev buttons to navigate inside the modal.
- Dark Mode.

I basically learned React while doing it, so it took quite a bit of time. Any comments or constructive criticism are more than welcome!

Thanks for checking it out! :)
